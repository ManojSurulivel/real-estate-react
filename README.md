Real Estate Project

Here is the complete file structure for the Real Estate Project using React and Redux Toolkit with filtering and state management.

1. Redux Store Setup:

store.js:

Create a Redux store using Redux Toolkit and define the slice for managing properties.

2. Property Slice (State Management):

propertySlice.js (Inside features/properties/):

This slice will manage both the list of properties and the filtering logic.

3. Main Application Component:

App.js:

The main component renders the property list and favorites.

4. FilterBar.js: Component for Filtering Properties

FilterBar.js:

This component filters properties by type (e.g., Villa, Apartment).

5. PropertyList.js: Display Filtered Properties

PropertyList.js:

This component displays the filtered properties.

6. PropertyCard.js: Display Individual Property Cards
   
PropertyCard.js:

Each property is displayed as a card.

7. Favorites.js: Display Favorite Properties

Favorites.js:

This component shows the properties that the user has marked as favorites.

How It Works:

State Management with Redux Toolkit: The property slice handles the filtering and management of the properties and favorites.

Filtering: The FilterBar component dispatches a filter action based on the user selection, and PropertyList shows the filtered properties.

Favorites: The user can add or remove properties from the "Favorites" list.
